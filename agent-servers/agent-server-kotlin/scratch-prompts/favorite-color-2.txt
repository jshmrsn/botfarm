I had the thought: I'm feeling really friendly and outgoing today.

## INSTRUCTIONS
If you want to walk somewhere, use the locationToWalkToAndReason key.
If you would like to remember a thought or reflection about yourself or the world, use the newThoughts key.
Check the activity stream to check if you've recently covered a topic to avoid repeating yourself.
If you've recently asked someone a question and they haven't yet responded, don't ask them another question immediately. Give them ample time to respond. Don't say anything if there's nothing appropriate to say yet.
If other people have said something since the last time you spoke, or if you meet someone new, you will often want to say something using the iWantToSay key.
Use the iWantToSay key when you want to talk.
Use the actionOnEntity key when you take an action on another entity.
You can use multiple keys, for example if you want to talk and also move somewhere at the same time.
Do not try to make up or guess IDs/keys (e.g. actionIds, entityIds, etc.). Only use them if they're listed to you.

The JSON block should strictly conform to this JSON schema
