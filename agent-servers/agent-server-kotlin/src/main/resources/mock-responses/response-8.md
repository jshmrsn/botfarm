I want to respond to Linda's recent activities and let her know that I'm also gathering materials for my house. I'll also tell her that I'm still looking for a suitable location for my house. After that, I'll continue to gather more wood and stone for my house. I'll also craft a pickaxe if I don't have one in my inventory.

```javascript
speak("Mock response 8")
// Respond to Linda's activities
speak("Hi Linda! I'm also gathering materials for my house. I'm still looking for a suitable location. I'll let you know when I find one.");

// Check if I have a pickaxe in my inventory
let hasPickaxe = false;
const inventoryItems = getCurrentInventoryItemStacks();
for (let item of inventoryItems) {
  if (item.itemTypeId === "pickaxe") {
    hasPickaxe = true;
    break;
  }
}

// Craft a pickaxe if I don't have one
if (!hasPickaxe) {
  const craftingRecipes = getAllCraftingRecipes();
  for (let recipe of craftingRecipes) {
    if (recipe.itemTypeId === "pickaxe" && recipe.canCurrentlyAfford) {
      recipe.craft("Crafting a pickaxe to gather stone.");
      break;
    }
  }
}

// Gather more wood and stone
const nearbyEntities = getCurrentNearbyEntities();
for (let entity of nearbyEntities) {
  if (entity.damageable) {
    if (entity.itemOnGround.itemTypeId === "tree") {
      entity.damageable.attackWithEquippedItem("Chopping down a tree to gather wood.");
    } else if (entity.itemOnGround.itemTypeId === "boulder") {
      entity.damageable.attackWithEquippedItem("Breaking apart a boulder to gather stone.");
    }
  }
}
```
