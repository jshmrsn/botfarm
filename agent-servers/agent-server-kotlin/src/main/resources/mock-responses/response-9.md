I would like to gather more wood and stone for my house. I also want to respond to Linda's question about my progress. I will tell her that I am still gathering materials and appreciate her offer for help.

```javascript
speak("Mock response 9")
// Respond to Linda's question
speak("Hey Linda, I'm still gathering materials. Thanks for offering help!");

// Check if there is a pickaxe in the inventory
let inventoryItems = getCurrentInventoryItemStacks();
let pickaxe = inventoryItems.find(item => item.itemTypeId === "pickaxe");

// If there is no pickaxe, craft one
if (!pickaxe) {
  let pickaxeRecipe = getAllCraftingRecipes().find(recipe => recipe.itemTypeId === "pickaxe");
  if (pickaxeRecipe && pickaxeRecipe.canCurrentlyAfford) {
    pickaxeRecipe.craft("Need a pickaxe to gather stone");
  }
}

// Equip the pickaxe if it's not already equipped
if (pickaxe && !pickaxe.isEquipped) {
  pickaxe.equip("Need to equip pickaxe to gather stone");
}

// Find a nearby boulder and harvest it
let nearbyEntities = getCurrentNearbyEntities();
let boulder = nearbyEntities.find(entity => entity.itemOnGround && entity.itemOnGround.itemTypeId === "boulder");
if (boulder && boulder.damageable) {
  walkTo(boulder.location, "Walking to boulder to gather stone");
  boulder.damageable.attackWithEquippedItem("Harvesting boulder for stone");
}

// Find a nearby tree and harvest it
let tree = nearbyEntities.find(entity => entity.itemOnGround && entity.itemOnGround.itemTypeId === "tree");
if (tree && tree.damageable) {
  walkTo(tree.location, "Walking to tree to gather wood");
  tree.damageable.attackWithEquippedItem("Harvesting tree for wood");
}
```
