I would like to respond to Linda's update about starting to build her house. I will congratulate her and share my own progress. I also want to continue gathering wood for my house. I will find the nearest tree, walk to it, and chop it down. If there's any wood on the ground nearby, I will pick it up. 

```js
speak("Mock response 5")
// Responding to Linda
speak("That's great, Linda! I'm still gathering wood for my house. Keep up the good work!");

```
