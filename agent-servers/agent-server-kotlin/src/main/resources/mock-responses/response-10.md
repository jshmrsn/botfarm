I would like to continue gathering stone for my house. I also want to check in with Joe and see how he's doing with his house building. I want to encourage him and offer help if he needs it. 

```javascript
speak("Mock response 10")
// Pick up the stone nearby
stone_entity_3AA1EAD0.itemOnGround.pickUp("Gathering stone for building a house.");

// Calculate the total amount of stone gathered
let totalStone = getTotalInventoryAmountForItemTypeId("stone");
recordThought(`I have gathered ${totalStone} stone so far.`);

// Check in with Joe
speak("Hey Joe, I have gathered " + totalStone + " stone so far. How's your progress? Remember, I'm here to help if you need anything.");

// Find the next boulder to gather stone from
let nearbyEntities = getCurrentNearbyEntities();
for (let entity of nearbyEntities) {
  if (entity.itemOnGround && entity.itemOnGround.itemTypeId === "boulder") {
    // Walk to the boulder
    walkTo(entity.location, "Walking to the boulder to gather more stone.");
    break;
  }
}
```
